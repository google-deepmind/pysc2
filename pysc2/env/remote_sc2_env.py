    """Create a SC2 Env that connects to a remote instance of the game.

    This assumes that the game is already up and running, and that it only
    needs to join the game - and leave once the game has ended. You need some
    other script to launch the SC2 process and call RequestCreateGame. Note
    that you must call close to leave the game when finished. Not doing so
    will lead to issues when attempting to create another game on the same
    SC2 process.

    This class assumes that the game is multiplayer. LAN ports may be
    specified either as a base port (from which the others will be implied),
    or as an explicit list.

    You must specify an agent_interface_format. See the `AgentInterfaceFormat`
    documentation for further detail.

    Args:
      _only_use_kwargs: Don't pass args, only kwargs.
      map_name: Name of a SC2 map. Run bin/map_list to get the full list of
          known maps. Alternatively, pass a Map instance. Take a look at the
          docs in maps/README.md for more information on available maps.
      save_map: Whether to save map data before joining the game.
      host: Host where the SC2 process we're connecting to is running.
      host_port: The WebSocket port for the SC2 process we're connecting to.
      lan_port: Either an explicit sequence of LAN ports corresponding to
          [server game port, ...base port, client game port, ...base port],
          or an int specifying base port - equivalent to specifying the
          sequence [lan_port, lan_port+1, lan_port+2, lan_port+3].
      race: Race for this agent.
      name: The name of this agent, for saving in the replay.
      agent_interface_format: AgentInterfaceFormat object describing the
          format of communication between the agent and the environment.
      discount: Returned as part of the observation.
      visualize: Whether to pop up a window showing the camera and feature
          layers. This won't work without access to a window manager.
      step_mul: How many game steps per agent step (action/observation). None
          means use the map default.
      realtime: Whether to use realtime mode. In this mode the game simulation
          automatically advances (at 22.4 gameloops per second) rather than
          being stepped manually. The number of game loops advanced with each
          call to step() won't necessarily match the step_mul specified. The
          environment will attempt to honour step_mul, returning observations
          with that spacing as closely as possible. Game loops will be skipped
          if they cannot be retrieved and processed quickly enough.
      replay_dir: Directory to save a replay.
      replay_prefix: An optional prefix to use when saving replays.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if the race is invalid.
      ValueError: if the resolutions aren't specified correctly.
      ValueError: if lan_port is a sequence but its length != 4.

"""The library and base Map for defining full maps.

To define your own map just import this library and subclass Map. It will be
automatically registered for creation by `get`.

  class NewMap(lib.Map):
    prefix = "map_dir"
    filename = "map_name"
    players = 3

You can build a heirarchy of classes to make your definitions less verbose.

To use a map, either import the map module and instantiate the map directly, or
import the maps lib and use `get`. Using `get` from this lib will work, but only
if you've imported the map module somewhere.
